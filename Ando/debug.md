The error "No match for {"name":"admin-dashboard","params":{}}" in your Laravel and Vue.js application indicates that the Vue Router is trying to navigate to a route named "admin-dashboard", but it cannot find a route with that name defined in your router configuration.

Here's a breakdown of why this happens and how to fix it:

**Understanding the Error:**

1. **Login Success (Likely):** The "XHR finished loading: POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/admin/login"." message suggests your login API call was successful.
2. **Attempting Redirection:** After successful login, your `handleLogin` function in `login.vue` is trying to redirect the user to a route named "admin-dashboard". This is happening around line 156 of your `login.vue` file.
3. **Router Failure:** The Vue Router then throws the "No match" error because it cannot find a route in your `router/index.js` (or similar router configuration file) that has the `name` property set to "admin-dashboard".

**Troubleshooting Steps and Solutions:**

Here's a systematic way to fix this:

**1. Verify Your Route Definition in `router/index.js` (or your router configuration file):**

   This is the most likely cause. Open your Vue Router configuration file (usually located at `resources/js/router/index.js` or `src/router/index.js`). Look for the definition of the "admin-dashboard" route.

   **Example of a Correct Route Definition:**

   ```javascript
   import { createRouter, createWebHistory } from 'vue-router';
   import AdminDashboard from '../components/AdminDashboard.vue'; // Adjust path as needed

   const routes = [
     {
       path: '/admin/dashboard', // Or any path you prefer
       name: 'admin-dashboard',
       component: AdminDashboard
     },
     // ... other routes
   ];

   const router = createRouter({
     history: createWebHistory(),
     routes
   });

   export default router;
   ```

   **Key Checks:**

   * **`name` Property:** Ensure you have a route object with `name: 'admin-dashboard'`. Typos are common here.
   * **`path` Property:**  Verify the `path` associated with the "admin-dashboard" route is correct (e.g., `/admin/dashboard`, `/dashboard`, etc.). This isn't directly causing the "No match" error, but it's important for the actual navigation.
   * **`component` Property:** Make sure the `component` property points to the correct Vue component that should be rendered for the admin dashboard. Ensure this component file exists at the specified path.
   * **Import Statements:**  Double-check the `import` statement for the `AdminDashboard` component. The path should be accurate.

**2. Inspect the Redirection Logic in `login.vue`:**

   Open your `login.vue` file and go to the `handleLogin` function around line 156. Examine the code that performs the redirection after successful login. It likely looks something like this:

   ```javascript
   async handleLogin() {
     try {
       const response = await axios.post('/api/admin/login', this.loginForm);
       // ... handle successful login (e.g., store token)

       this.$router.push({ name: 'admin-dashboard' }); // This line is causing the error
       // or
       // this.$router.push('/admin/dashboard'); // If you're using the path
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Login error:', error);
       // ... handle login error
     }
   }
   ```

   **Key Checks:**

   * **`this.$router.push({ name: 'admin-dashboard' })`:**  If you're using the route name for redirection, make absolutely sure the name matches exactly the `name` property in your router definition (including case).
   * **`this.$router.push('/admin/dashboard')`:** If you're using the path directly, ensure the path matches the `path` property in your router definition.

**3. Check for Typos and Case Sensitivity:**

   Route names and paths are case-sensitive. A simple typo in the route name in your router configuration or in the `this.$router.push()` call can lead to this error.

**4. Clear Browser Cache and Hard Reload:**

   Sometimes, the browser might be using an older version of your JavaScript files. Try clearing your browser cache and performing a hard reload (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R).

**5. Restart Your Development Server:**

   Make sure your Laravel development server (`php artisan serve`) and your Vue development server (`npm run watch` or `yarn watch` or `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`) are running after making changes to your route configuration.

**6. Ensure the `router` Instance is Correctly Injected:**

   In your `main.js` or `app.js` file (where you initialize your Vue application), make sure you're correctly importing and using your router instance:

   ```javascript
   // resources/js/app.js or src/main.js

   import { createApp } from 'vue';
   import App from './App.vue';
   import router from './router'; // Assuming your router is in ./router/index.js

   const app = createApp(App);
   app.use(router);
   app.mount('#app');
   ```

**7. Consider Route Parameters (Less Likely in this specific error, but good to know):**

   If your "admin-dashboard" route expects parameters, you need to provide them in the `this.$router.push()` call:

   ```javascript
   // In router/index.js
   {
     path: '/admin/dashboard/:userId',
     name: 'admin-dashboard',
     component: AdminDashboard
   }

   // In login.vue
   this.$router.push({ name: 'admin-dashboard', params: { userId: 123 } });
   ```

   While the error message shows `params: {}`, double-checking for expected parameters is a good practice if you encounter similar issues later.

**Debugging Tips:**

* **Console Logging:** Add `console.log(this.$router.resolve({ name: 'admin-dashboard' }))` before the `this.$router.push()` call in your `login.vue`. This will show you how Vue Router is trying to resolve the route and can help identify if the name is being interpreted correctly.
* **Vue Devtools:** Use the Vue Devtools browser extension. It has a "Routes" tab that displays all your defined routes, making it easy to verify your configuration.

**In summary, the most probable cause of this error is a mismatch between the route name you're using in your `this.$router.push()` call in `login.vue` and the `name` property of the "admin-dashboard" route defined in your `router/index.js` file.** Carefully review these files for typos and ensure the names are identical.
